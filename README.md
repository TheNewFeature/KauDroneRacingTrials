- KDR 2024 simulator runs based on [AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/)
- Server connection is not stable at the moment, however bestlap data is always stored loaclly. By pressing upload best lap button, your locally saved best lap data will be posted online, only if server is online.
- Feel free to ask questions : help@thenewfeature.com

- Create your own code based on DemoBaseline.py and don't forget to add AI functionallity. The gates inside the simulator will have random noises every session. That being said, with only the baseline code, the drone will not make it through the whole path.

- To update the simulator, copy the new .Pak file and paste it into KDR 2024 simulator/KDR_2024/Content/Paks/
